  - Auto-scaling enabled
  - Network policy: Azure CNI

### Container Registry
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**
  - Private container registry for application images
  - Geo-replication for global deployment
  - Premium SKU for advanced features
  - Integration with AKS for seamless deployments

### Database
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**
  - Flexible Server (v16)
  - Burstable B_Standard_B1ms (1 vCore, 2 GB RAM)
  - Auto-scaling enabled
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Private endpoint for secure access

### Caching & Session Store
- **Azure Cache for Redis**
  - Enterprise SKU for production workloads
  - Clustering enabled for high availability
  - Data persistence with RDB snapshots
  - Private endpoint for secure access

### Security & Secrets
- **Azure Key Vault**
  - Centralized secrets management
  - Integration with AKS for pod identity
  - Certificate management
  - Access policies and RBAC

### Storage
- **Azure Blob Storage**
  - General Purpose v2 account
  - Hot tier for frequently accessed data
  - Private endpoint for secure access
  - Lifecycle management policies

## Network Architecture

- **Virtual Network (VNet)**
  - Private subnets for AKS, databases, and storage
  - Network Security Groups (NSGs) for traffic control
  - Azure Firewall for outbound traffic filtering

- **Private Endpoints**
  - Secure access to PaaS services
  - No public internet exposure
  - DNS resolution through Azure Private DNS

## Security Features

- **Managed Identity**
  - AKS system-assigned managed identity
  - Pod identity for workload authentication
  - Key Vault integration for secrets access

- **RBAC & Policies**

  - Resource locks to prevent accidental deletion
  - Azure Policy for compliance enforcement

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Azure Monitor**
  - Container insights for AKS
  - Log Analytics workspace
  - Application Insights for application monitoring
  - Custom dashboards and alerts

## Cost Optimization

- **Reserved Instances**
  - 1-year reservations for stable workloads
  - Spot instances for non-critical workloads
  - Auto-shutdown for development environments

## Deployment Strategy

- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - Terraform for resource provisioning
  - Bicep templates for Azure-specific resources
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

- **Environment Separation**
  - Development, staging, and production environments
  - Resource naming conventions
  - Cost allocation tags

## Future Considerations

- **Multi-region Deployment**
  - Active-active configuration
  - Global load balancing
  - Disaster recovery planning

- **Advanced Security**
  - Azure Sentinel for SIEM
  - Advanced Threat Protection
  - Compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
